        <h2>The Problem:</h2> 
        <p>In many jobs, schedules are used to communicate to workers the days in which they need to work.</p>
        <p>These schedules are planned to fulfill the job requirements and work-health regulations.</p>
        <p>However, there are times where these schedules may not satisfy each worker's individual preference and may cause them to be unhappy.</p>
        <p>This may occur because the planner may not understand what the work is like as they might not have done it before.</p>
        <p>Also, the planner might be inexperienced and may not understand how to plan a good schedule.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Goal:</h2>
        <p>I want to create a schedule generator that generates schedules that fulfill job requirement and work-health regulations.</p> 
        <p>After that, it will take the worker's preference into consideration and figure out the best schedules to implement.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The General Idea:</h2>
        <p>First, the user will input the required details into a form.(shifts, workers and requirements/limitations)</p>
        <p>Second, the software will generate all the possible combinations based on the requirements and limitations.</p>
        <p>Third, the software will scan all the schedule combinations and score them based on certain factors(based on worker preferences).</p>
        <p>Fourth, the software will sort the schedule combinations and display best combinations on top.</p>
        <p>Fifth, the user can also input some information into a a blank schedule to find matching schedule combinations.</p> 
        <p>Finally, the user can export the schedule into an excel or google sheet file.</p>
