        <h1>Development of Hwat? Schedule Generator <p><a href="sGenMain.html">To Schedule Page</a></p><p><a href="hwatMain.html">To Main Page</a></p></h1>
        <hr>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is the first programming project that I am undertaking as a beginner self taught programmer. I am learning progamming from zero so this program will not be perfect.<p>
        <p>This generator is designed based on my personal experience and may not cater to all the schedules in the world.</p>
        <p>If you have a schedule that isn't able to be generated by this software, feel free to drop me an email and I will see how I can tweek it to your specifications. No Guarantee.</p>
        <p>If you are unsure of how to use this schedule generator, do refer to the tutorial or drop me an email and I will try to create a schedule for you. No Guarantee.</p>

        <h1>The Idea</h1>
        <p>Before starting, I have decided that this software should be useable from both mobile and PC and have settled on web to build my program.</p>
        <p>I have also thought about offline usage but I am not experienced enough to know what framework to use for my program.</p>
        <p>The program is spilt up into 5 parts: Input, Generate, Scan, Score, Sort/Filter, Export</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Getting Information</li>
                <p>The required information to generate a schedule are: shift details, worker details, requirements, limitations and preferences</p>
                <p>A form will be used to gather required information from the user.</p>
                <p>2 methods that I have thought about are: 1.Sentence Forming 2.Graphical Input</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Details of all the information required</p>
                    <li>Day or Month</li>
                    <p>There will be an option to choose between generating a hourly schedule for 24 hours or a monthly schedule</p>
                    <li>Shift Details</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All Shift Types</li>
                            <li>Shift Name</li>
                            <li>Shift Abbreviation</li>
                            <li>Shift Duration</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Each shift must be a factor of 24(for OCD's sake)</li>
                                    <li>Each shift must be a multiple of the shortest shift duration(for OCD's sake)</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Shift Start Time(for fixed time shifts)</li>
                            <li>Shift Description</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Worker Details</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Worker Name</li>
                            <li>Worker Name Abbreviation(to be displayed in schedule)</li>
                            <li>Worker Rank/Position/Type</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: Fulltimer, Partimer.. to make it easier to input what each rank can/cannot do</li>
                                    <li>Input X Workers work Y days/hours. Z Workers work B days/hours. C Workers work D days/hours. Calculate the amount of rest they have</li>
                                    <li>Or..Input X Workers work Y times as much as Z Workers, X Workers work B times as much as C Workers and calculate the amount of rest they have</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>This is to determine the rest ratio/multiplier of rest for each type of worker</li>
                                            <li>For Example: Partimers work 10 days and Fulltimers work 20 days in a 30-day month</li>
                                            <li>Partimers Rest 20 days and Fulltimers rest 10 days in a 30-day month</li>
                                            <li>Thus, the rest days of fulltimers are worth twice as much as a partimer.</li>
                                            <li>This is to balance the working hours of each worker type.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Worker Team</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: Team A, Team B... to make it easier to assign the dates that each team will be working</li>
                                </ul>
    
                        </ul>
                    <li>Requirements</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This will be implemented by creating sentences.</li>
                            <li>Planner will also be able to add notes for each statement</li>
                            <li>Example for month schedule: Every day must have X amount of Y shifts</li>
                            <li>Example for month schedule: Every day must have A amount of B shifts</li>
                            <li>Example for month schedule*(situational): Day C must have D amount of E shifts</li>
                            <li>Example for day schedule: Every hour must have X amount of Y shifts</li>
                            <li>Example for day schedule: Every hour must have A amount of B shifts</li>
                            <li>Example: Day X to Day Y, Worker/Worker Type Z must do A shift</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Anti-requirements</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This will be implemented by creating sentences.</li>
                            <li>Planner will also be able to add notes for each statement</li>
                            <li>Example: Day X to Day Y, Worker Z must not do A shift. (on leave/schooling,recovering,sick...)</li>
                            <li>Exmaple: Worker/Worker Type Z(Fulltimer/Partimer) cannot do Y work on day X, hour A (only for month planner), too complicated </li>
                            <li>Exmaple: Worker/Worker Type Z(Team) cannot do Y work on hour A </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            <li>Generating all possible combinations</li>
            <p>The software will take in the information and generate based on the requirements and limitations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Permuations of multisets</li>
                    <li>Arrays</li>
                    <li>2D Arrays</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Scanning and scoring the combination</li>
            <p>There are 2 components to this: scanning and sorting</p>
            <p>The scanning portion will make use of a combing system that looks for certain patterns</p>
            <p>The scoring portion will detect a certain pattern and assign points accordingly</p>
            <p>The scoring will also use standard deviation and variance to generate a balanced score across the workers for some factors.</p>
            <p>There are 5 factors that I have thought of to score every schedule combination by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rest Score: Amount and quality of rest</li>
                <li>Shift Change/Pattern Score: Worker's preference for certain shift patterns</li>
                <li>Shift Score: Worker's preference for certain shift</li>
                <li>Relaibility Score: How often a reliable senior is available</li>
                <li>Replaceability Score: How easy it is to replace someone on a particular day</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are 5 factors explained in more details.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shift Score: Worker's preference for certain shift</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>detects shifts that workers like and gives 1 point</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Shift Change/Pattern Score: Worker's preference for certain shift patterns</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>detects shift patterns that workers like and gives 1 point</li>
                                    <li>detects shift patterns that workers hate and deduct 1 point</li>
                                    <li>detects improbable shift patterns that workers and discards the combination(i should program this into the generator instead)</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Rest Score: Amount and quality of rest</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For monthly(per day) Schedule</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Balanced Profile: Incentivize 2-3 day breaks</li>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>detects 1-day rest and gives 1 point</li>
                                                    <li>detects 2-day rest and gives 3 point</li>
                                                    <li>detects 3-day rest and gives 6 point</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            <li>Choppy Profile: Incentivize 1 day breaks</li>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>detects 1-day rest and gives 2 point</li>

                                                </ul>
                                            <li>Grind Hard Rest Hard Profile: Incentivize 1 day breaks and more than 3 day breaks</li>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>detects 1-day rest and gives 2 point</li>

                                                    <li>detects 3-day rest and gives 3 point</li>
                                                    <li>detects more than 3-day rest and gives 9 point</li>
                                                </ul> 
                                        </ul>
                                    <li>For daily(hour) Schedule: Shifts are stacked (default) towards night/day, discourages medium duration breaks due to lack of quality sleep (4-8 hour breaks)?</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Balanced Profile: Incentivize 2-3 day breaks</li>    
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>detects 1-3 hour rests and gives 1 point/hour</li>
                                                    <li>detects 4-8 hour rests and gives 0.5 point/hour(deduct points)</li>
                                                    <li>detects more than 8 hour rests and gives 1 point/hour</li>

                                        </ul>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Relaibility Score: How often a reliable senior is available</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>detect the amount of days/hour where at least 1 senior is around and gives 1 point</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Replaceability Score: How easy it is to replace someone on a particular day</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Incentivize longs breaks and shift patterns where it is easy to slot someone in to replace</li>
                                    <li>Imagine a worker working 2 days, resting 3 days, it is easier(more humane) to slot him in front of his 2 day shift because he still has a 2 day break aftewards</li>
                                    <li>Imagine a worker working 3 days, resting 2 days, it is harder(more inhumane) to slot him in front of his 3 day shift because he only has a 1 day break aftewards after working 4 days</li>
                                </ul>
                        </ul>
            <li>Sorting and Filtering combinations</li>
            <p>The program will rank the schedule combinations via a default order(Rest to Pattern to Shift to Reliability to Replaceability). The user can also change the order or sorting.</p>
            <p>There will also be a schedule blank to allow user input to find a pattern that matches his input.</p>
            <li>Displaying & Exporting</li>
            <p>The final step will be to display the schedule and translate these set of data into an excel, google sheet or image file.</p>
        </ol>
